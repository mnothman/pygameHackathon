# pygameHackathon
Was made for the https://pygames.devpost.com/ devpost hackathon hosted by Microsoft.
Took a premade cheat engine very similar to what I wanted and supplemented it.
To run the game, while in the main file click run code.

Use WASD for movement and left + right arrow keys for direction.

The slender object is an slideshow of multiple images that is redrawn to simulate him walking.
